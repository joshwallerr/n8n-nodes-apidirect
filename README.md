# n8n-nodes-apidirect

This is an n8n community node. It lets you use [API Direct](https://apidirect.io) in your n8n workflows.

API Direct is a pay-as-you-go social listening API that searches real-time data across social media, news, and the web through a single unified interface — no subscriptions, you only pay for the requests you make.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/sustainable-use-license/) workflow automation platform.

## Credentials

1. Sign up at [apidirect.io](https://apidirect.io) — new accounts get $5 of free credit, plus 50 free requests per endpoint per month.
2. Create an API key at [apidirect.io/dashboard/keys](https://apidirect.io/dashboard/keys).
3. In n8n, create new **API Direct API** credentials and paste the key.

The credential test calls the cheapest endpoint (`/v1/time`, $0.001) to verify the key.

## Compatibility

Requires n8n 1.94.0 or later. Developed and tested against n8n 1.x (2026).

## Usage

- **Pagination**: list operations take a `Page` or `Pages` field instead of cursors. Where the API fetches multiple pages server-side in one call (`Pages`), each page is billed as one request — `Pages: 3` costs 3× the per-page price.
- **Pricing**: every operation's description shows its price ($0.001–$0.01 per request/page). There are no subscriptions or monthly minimums. See [pricing](https://apidirect.io/docs/pricing).
- **Dependent IDs**: some Facebook operations need IDs returned by others — e.g. `Page Details` returns the `page_id`, `delegate_page_id`, and `reels_page_id` used by the page posts/videos/reels operations, and `Search Locations` returns the `location_id` used to filter post/event searches.
- **AI Agent tool**: the node is marked usable as a tool, so it can be attached to n8n AI Agents.
